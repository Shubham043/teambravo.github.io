    <h1> About our website: </h1>
    <p> There are many ways to deal with Cyber bullying
        One is to ignore but where is the fun in ignoring and also till when a person can ignore...
        so we have a better way to make yourself feel better by replying those trolls
         with some savage replies...presented by Bravo 6 <img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/happy.jpg?w=800&quality=85" alt=""></p>
         <h2> So what to do :</h2>
         <p> don't be angry, try to be calm and relax</p>
         <h3> 1st step </h3>
         <p>There's no need to justify your choices when someone hurls an insult, especially if your response isn't likely to help. So rather than get into a debate about why the comment is hurtful, a simple thank you can be the best way to move forward, but when limit is over we have to do something..</p>
         <h4> 2nd step</h4>
         <p>Make your response short and quick so that they understand that you will not engage. Simply say “Okay” or “Thank you for that” in response to them. If you do feel like there's any truth in the insult, make the decision to only take the information that's helpful to your growth. Then, ignore the rest</p>
